[My Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2346124-Private-Trainer-Course-List)

This is a swift exercise of Private Trainer's Onboarding Animation(It is also show the course category of this app),user will see this anim if he is not login.

Had spent so many time on implementing other designer's design.This time try to write code for myself.I have myself's design files,so I can get the right value of animation.

Not much logic code,just some animation adjustment when viewwillappear,will spend some time making the tableview part.

Roadmap:

1.Implement all the design (WIP)
2.Seperate the FAB component
3.Package/Refactoring At last
